# Angry Bullet Game

In this project, a simple Angry Birds-like game is implemented using Java and **StdDraw** graphics library. 
This is a simple 2D game where the player tries to hit various targets by adjusting the angle and velocity of a projectile. 

## Features

- **Adjustable Projectile Parameters**: The player can control the angle and velocity of the projectile using arrow keys.
- **Multiple Obstacles and Targets**: The game includes various obstacles and targets. The goal is to hit the targets while avoiding the obstacles.
- **Real-time Projectile Simulation**: The bullet trajectory is dynamically calculated based on real-world physics, including gravity.
- **Game Controls**: The player can control the game using the keyboard (see below for controls).
- **Reset Option**: After a shot, the game can be reset to try again.

## How to Play

- **Increase Angle**: Press the `Up Arrow` to increase the shooting angle.
- **Decrease Angle**: Press the `Down Arrow` to decrease the shooting angle.
- **Increase Velocity**: Press the `Right Arrow` to increase the projectile velocity.
- **Decrease Velocity**: Press the `Left Arrow` to decrease the projectile velocity.
- **Shoot**: Press the `Space` key to launch the projectile.
- **Reset**: Press the `R` key to reset the game and try again.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above.
- **StdDraw** library for handling drawing and animations. You can download it from [here](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/).
